Here are some analysis that i've done using python.

## 1. Basics_Statistics - [code](Basic_Statistics-1.ipynb) 
Performed descriptive analytics, data visualization, and preprocessing on a sales dataset that includes discount-related information.

### Descriptive Statistics for Numerical Columns
Calculated key statistical measures for numerical columns:

- Mean (Average value)
- Median (Middle value)
- Mode (Most frequent value)
- Standard Deviation (Measure of data spread)

### Data Visualization
Created various plots to understand data distributions:

- Histograms (For checking skewness and distribution of numerical columns)
- Boxplots (For detecting outliers and variability)
- Bar Charts (For categorical column distributions)

### Standardization of Numerical Variables

- Applied Z-score normalization to scale numerical columns, ensuring they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- Before and after standardization, histograms were plotted to visualize changes.

### Conversion of Categorical Data into Dummy Variables
Categorical variables were converted into numerical format (dummy/one-hot encoding) for machine learning compatibility.
